This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project which aims to shorten URLs.

## How to run

You can install the dependencies and run the development server with

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can also run the unit tests with

```bash
yarn jest
```

## Notes

A production environment would probably require using something else than a simple, local JSON file to store the URLs; we could for example use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or any other similar product.
